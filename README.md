# FarmsConnect
FarmsConnect is an application designed to create agricultural inclusion. The platform aims to create a designation where people can invest in the production of farm products available and earn a healty return on investment over a specified period. 

# Motivation
People are hardly interested in directly engaging in the production of food, especially at the very early stages of farming but many are interested in how their food is produced, handled and distributed. With FarmsConnect people can engage in contributing to how their food is produced and earn susbstantially on their contributions.

# Getting Started
To get started with using this application, you must create an account within the application. The account is free and requires you to own only a digital deveice. The application informs you about on-going farm projects which you can invest in. As an investor you'll have the ability to follow the activities of a farm through emails, videos and periodic on-site visits. An investor will be able to calculate their returns on investment through their dashboard to understand what they stand to gain over the calculated period.
